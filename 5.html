    <!-- Execute a JavaScript immediately after a page has been loaded.
        onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files and CSS files, etc.)
            The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and laod the proper version of the web page based on the information. 
            The onload event can also be used to deal with cookies. 
            Every browser supports this.

    <!-- 
    The <pre> tag defines preformatted text. 
        Text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. -->
